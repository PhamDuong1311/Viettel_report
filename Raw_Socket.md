# What are Raw Sockets?
## 1. The Sockets API
When opening a socket, we should determine the address family (the underlying network type), the socket type (exchange pattern), and, optionally, the communication protocol. If we donâ€™t specify the protocol, the kernel will choose the default one for the given address family and socket type.
